# Mach-Simulator
Simple motion and sound simulator. The purpose of this is to illustrate how sound waves spread from a moving point and how they bunch up into a "sound carpet" at supersonic speeds. This took me 30 minutes in Pygame so it's not that impressive but thought it was worth sharing.
Uses 2 CLI args, velocity and acceleration. Acceleration should be a very low value (around 0.001) otherwise the sprite zooms off the screen.
